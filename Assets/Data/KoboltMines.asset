  title: Miners in deep trouble.!
  caseFileDescription: A large cobalt mine in Kongo has collapsed! Several miners
    are trapped (and rare metal production halted). Search and rescue!
  difficulty: 2
  winResult: Great success! Our agent managed to squeeze in through the rubble and
    delivered supplies until the cave was cleared. $BEST_ITEM was surprisingly helpful.
  lossResult: Oh no! Our agent got in too late because of a failed $BEST_ITEM and
    the miners had already suffocated. However, this was only a minor inconvenience
    and electric car battery industry soon recovered.
